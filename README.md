# 📊 End-to-End-Sales-Profitability-Analysis---SUPERSTORE

## 🚀 Project Overview
Comprehensive data analysis project focused on minimizing profit leakage and maximizing growth opportunities within a 4-year Superstore dataset. Features a full analytical pipeline from Python cleaning and SQL transactional risk analysis to Power BI dashboard reporting for actionable strategic recommendations.


## 🔦💡Key Findings & Strategic Recommendations
The analysis identified critical areas for business intervention and resulted in the following actionable insights:

| Finding Category | Key Insights | Business Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Profit Leakage** | High discounts (over 40%) in specific sub-categories lead to significant losses, with high-risk orders exceeding **-$3,700**. | Requires immediate policy adjustment on discount caps for identified sub-categories. |
| **Category Strategy** | **Technology** drives the majority of high-margin profit. **Furniture** contains all loss-making sub-categories (Tables, Bookcases). | Focus promotional resources on Technology; initiate review of pricing and cost for Furniture loss leaders. |
| **Market Resilience** | The dataset validates strong market resilience, identifying a **-2.83% sales dip in 2015** followed by a strong **29% recovery in 2016**. | Confirms the effectiveness of strategic pivots and the need for continuous YoY performance monitoring. |
| **Service Risk** | The **East region** consistently shows the highest return count, despite not being the highest sales region. | Suggests potential issues with regional logistics, shipping quality, or product handling that require investigation. |

## ⚙️ Technical Workflow & Tools
The project follows a robust **ETL/ELT pipeline**, validating end-to-end data proficiency:

| Tool | Role in Project | Key Functions Performed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)** | **Data Cleaning & Analysis** | Handled data quality issues, performed EDA, Time Series analysis, and built an ML model for profit classification. |
| **SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL)** | **Modeling & Advanced Querying** | Created normalized tables, performed profitability ranking, and executed complex queries for **Transactional Risk Analysis**. |
| **Power BI** | **Visualization & Reporting** | Designed an interactive dashboard for executive reporting, focusing on regional performance, profit trends, and return metrics. |
